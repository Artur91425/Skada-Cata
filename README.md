## IMPORTANT: How to install

1. If you used the default on **Skada** before, please make sure to delete all its files from `Interface\AddOns` folder as well as all its _SavedVariables_ from `WTF` folder (_just delete all `Skada.lua` and `Skada.lua.bak` for this folder. Use the search box for quick delete_). If you are new, skip this step.
2. [Download the package](https://github.com/bkader/Skada-Cata/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
3. Open the Zip package inside which you will find a single folder named `Skada-Cata-main`.
4. Extract or drag and drop the unique folder `Skada` into your `Interface\AddOns` folder.
5. If you want to use `SkadaImprovement` module, drop it there as well.
